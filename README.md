## Info
A slick UI for a website with images with quotes imprinted on them. Can be used as a starting point. Supports a workbench demo that would be available to the users and it has this cozy "hygge" theme all around. I have a similar project deployed [here](https://www.melpogram.com), one of my first creations with lovable.
